## Description 

This web app was created for people who like recording how long they actually work each day and want to use time management methods such as the Pomodoro technique to stay in the flow.

You can read more about the [Pomodoro technique on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

Once on the app you will be prompted to begin your stopwatch. This will activate the Pomodoro timer.

Once you complete the timer you will hear a notification and see two new buttons appear. The first with a message saying you have received a break, the second asking if you would like to cancel and start a new Pomodoro timer, the stopwatch will continue until you pause it or take your break. After 4 completed Pomodoro session you receive a longer break. 

The stopwatch's reset button will reset everything, while the timer's will only reset the Pomodoro back to 25mins. 

Alternatively you can use the application locally. Please clone the repository and install the dependencies before running either the dev command or build then preview from the package.json.
